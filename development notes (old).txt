PLAN

+ separate modules
- refactoring

- unittest
- logging
- black
- Path
- newer wordbank?
- spacy
- flair
- flask


TBD:
===

articles:
--------

 remove only 10/20 articles, not all (the same for prepositions)
 
deriv:
-----

 auto-expand the dict: ...able -> ...ably etc.

 export word candidates for derivation not already on the database (use list of known affixes)

 remove ...ise -> ...ized; ...fy -> ...fied (unnecessary 'derivatives'), use rule: first word in
 line ends in 'ise' and then line has forms 'ises', 'ising', etc.

 affix list in Word Part Level Test?

 remove pre... from derivatives

 wife-wives?
 
 used once in the text?

 classic derivatives and inflections+derivatives

errors:
------

 use edit distance for error generation

 to v1 -> to v3

 key point -> key moment

 V2 instead of V1, V3 etc. (irregular verbs)

 same vs. such

 felt -> fell

 's -> ''

 (common lexical and grammatical errors)

 only grammar, only spelling, grammar & spelling

 errors in phrases, not only separate words

 get errors from Longman Common Errors

 A grade bug -> A is not an article (add to exceptions?)

fragments: 
---------

 formatting issue (quote after, not before gap): It added: (5) "There is no intention to humiliate
 women. In contrast, we want to tell the men to learn from women on how to take care of clothes."
 -> It added: (5) __________". In contrast, we want to tell the men to learn from women on how to
 take care of clothes."

 a) i get it done
 f) i pay the rent," she said
 
 mark beginning and ending of fragments in answers
 
 add submodes?
 
 set percentage of fragments to remove?
 
general:
-------

 work with the target vocabulary only (get word lists and inflect): in this way no sophisticated
 NLP like, for example, named entity recognition is needed. If the word is unknown, no need to make
 gaps/errors with it.

 word order exercise

 stems?

 stats: general (how many texts/exercise files, how many total gaps etc.)

 rank texts in size; categorize and find 'similar' texts (difficulty and size)

 extract collocations from text (+ new exercise type?)

 stats: cumulative gaps made per exercise type?

 optimize making variants of exercise (don't do the whole thing every time)

 what kind of sentences are _generally_ good for making gaps in? (sentence length, punctuation,
 other factors?)

 don't make gaps in first sentence (establishes context)

 external settings for exercise types (presets)

 calibrate complexity rates with Cambridge texts (Lexile?), make standards (E, PI, I, UI, A)

 multiple choice & word frequency?

 tokenize differently: well-cared -> well-cared (hyphen shouldn't go to punc!)

 put rare1, rare2 and acad words in ONE file in each subfolder

 determiners exercise: a, the, some, this, every, these, another?

 autocheck tasks?

 removed sentences task

 use common readability measures (Flesch etc.)

 use definitions from NGSL for exercises

 split sentences at semicolons? - this should make sentence length ratio more accurate? or not?

multiple choice:
---------------

 find a way to generate distractors

open cloze:
----------

 use probability (high prob -> can remove), esp. content words

 do not make gaps in a single-word / unfinished sentence: I must go. However... (ï¿½) -/-> I must go.
 _____...

 BEC Higher has open cloze too

 make gap per sentence? or just wider distance between gaps (min(3 or factor of num of sentences))

 group words within wordlists? e.g. ('although', 'though') to avoid repetition? articles too?

 experiment with content words, e.g. time, came etc.?

 'What Money Can't Buy' - title of a book, 'what' removed - check if no rpunc, following word
 capitalized, not beginning of a sentence

 add negative auxilaries?

verbs:
-----

 give preference to longer questions (is becoming > became)

 verbs that can be nouns but are used after didn't, hasn't etc. -> verb forms

 verbs h answ key: (11) completely severed

 verbs that are homonyms of nouns/adjectives - use tagging (nltk?)
